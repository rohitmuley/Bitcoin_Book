Cash and Credit.  


A cash-based system needs to be “bootstrapped” with some initial
allocation of cash, without which no trades can occur. A credit-based system doesn’t need
bootstrapping, but the drawback is that anyone who’s owed a debt is taking on some risk. There’s a
chance that the other person never comes back to settle the debt.
Cash also allows us to be precise about how much something is worth. If you’re bartering, it’s hard to
say if a tool is worth more than medicine or medicine is worth more than food. Cash lets us use
numbers to talk about value. That’s why we use a blended system today — even when we’re using
credit, we measure debt in the amount of cash it would take to settle it.

peer-to-peer file-sharing networks must deal with the problem of
“freeloaders,” that is, users who download files without sharing in turn.


In SET, when you are ready to make a purchase, your browser passes your view of the transaction details to a shopping
application on your computer which, together with your credit card details, encrypts it in such a way
that only the intermediary can decrypt it, and no one else can (including the seller). Having encrypted
your data it this way, you can send it to the seller knowing that it’s secure. The seller blindly forwards
the encrypted data to the intermediary — along with their own view of the transaction details. The
intermediary decrypts your data and approves the transaction only if your view matches the seller’s
view.  

Why didn’t SET work? The fundamental problem has to do with certificates. A certificate is a way to
securely associate a cryptographic identity, that is, a public key, with a real-life identity. It’s what a
website needs to obtain, from companies like Verisign that are called certification authorities, in order
to show up as secure in your browser (typically indicated by a lock icon). Putting security before
usability, CyberCash and SET decided that not only would processors and merchants in their system
have to get certificates, all users would have to get one as well. Getting a certificate is about as
pleasant as doing your taxes, so the system was a disaster.
